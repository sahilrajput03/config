	# TUNNELING SERVICES: 
	# This forwards port 8081 on the remote machine (the SSH server) to port 81 on the local machine (your computer). Anyone on the remote machine connecting to localhost:8081 will actually reach localhost:81 on your local machine.
	RemoteForward 8081 localhost:81
	# Similar to the previous line, this forwards port 8082 on the remote machine to port 82 on the local machine.
	RemoteForward 8082 localhost:82
	# This forwards port 8099 on your local machine (the SSH client) to port 85 on the remote machine. Anyone connecting to localhost:8099 on your local machine will actually reach localhost:85 on the remote machine.
	LocalForward 8099 localhost:85
	# This configuration is commonly used for tunneling services between local and remote machines. Examples include:
	# 1. Accessing local services (e.g., on ports 81 and 82) from the remote machine.
	# 2. Accessing remote services (e.g., on port 85) from the local machine.

# SYNTAX HELP(all below syntax works):
## Below entry DOESN'T works bcoz files in ~/.ssh folder can NOT be specified without path because they can only work if your cwd is also ~/.ssh so as a best practise always specify full path to identity file even if the file is in ~/.ssh directory.
### >> ## xxxxx ### IdentityFile "april-2022" ## << THIS IS WRONG
