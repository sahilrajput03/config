> > An application is a program which you interact with on the desktop.

A process is an instance of a particular executable (.exe program file) running.

A service is a process which runs in the background and does not interact with the desktop. In Windows, services almost always run as an instance of the svchost.exe process, the windows service host process; however there are sometimes exceptions to this.

Sometimes, processes may run in the background without interacting with the desktop, but without being installed as a service.

Antivirus programs usually employ a service so they can continue running even when the user is not logged in.

Processes usually exit when an application is closed, however this is not always the case. Some programs, particularly download and backup programs, may continue to run in the background without displaying any windows. Antivirus is also an example of this - in addition to using a service, many antivirus applications run a process silently in the background which only displays an application to the user when action is required.

Please give me better information about service. Thanks.

changing password policy:

First you login with mysql -u root -p and check the current policy rules by:

# SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'validate_password%';

+--------------------------------------+--------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+--------------------------------------+--------+
| validate_password_dictionary_file | |
| validate_password_length | 5 |
| validate_password_mixed_case_count | 1 |
| validate_password_number_count | 1 |
| validate_password_policy | MEDIUM |
| validate_password_special_char_count | 1 |
+--------------------------------------+--------+
Then you can change any of the above variables at your will:

# SET GLOBAL validate_password_length = 5;

# SET GLOBAL validate_password_number_count = 0;

# SET GLOBAL validate_password_mixed_case_count = 0;

# SET GLOBAL validate_password_special_char_count = 0;

Finally you can create a database and a user accessing it with a simpler password:

# CREATE USER 'laravel'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'laravel';

# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON _._ TO 'laravel'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

# CREATE DATABASE laravel;

# FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

After that you can login with mysql -u user1 -p laravel using password laravel

READ ACCESS ONLY TO THE FOLDER{ the folder may be owned by the root, just get the permissions back
change ownership of a folder along with the files and subfolders
This is usually helpful when we dont have the write access to the partiton.

chown -R owner:group /dirname #to change both owner and group owner
chown -R owner: /dev/sda4 #to change only owner
chown -R :group /dev/sda4 #to change only group owner
chown -R owner:group /dev/sda4
chown -R $USER:$USER /dev/sda4

-R (recursive chown)

ntfsfux /dev/sda3
USEFUL: when we have a read only situation in ubuntu, due to the hibernated fuddupanti of windows fast startfup.

SSH USING PUBLIC PRIVATE KEY::

sudo service ssh start
systemctl status ssh
ststemctl start ssh

METHOD 1
ssh-keygen
file_name>> <blank>
passphrase>> <optional>
ssh-copy-id <target_user>@<target_ip>
ssh <target_user>@<target_ip>

METHOD 2 (with defined file-name)
ssh-keygen
file_name>> sk1
passphrase>> <optional>
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/sk1.pub <target_user>@<target_ip> #this uses the public key with name sk1.pub
ssh -i ~/.ssh/sk1 <target_user>@<target_ip> #this uses the private key with name sk1

##ssh-copy-id > basically copies the content of the public key <specified> to the file authorized_keys in the target pc i.e., </home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys>
